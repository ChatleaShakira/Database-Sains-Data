# Database-Sains-Data
My team's final project in the Database for Sains Data course\
\
Database Sains Data is one of the elective courses in the Statistics program at the University of Indonesia that I took in my fourth semester. This course is designed to enable students to retrieve, modify, and analyze data from a database using SQL with logical principles. The course was a great opportunity for me to learn how to work with databases and how to use SQL to extract valuable insights from data. I enjoyed the course and found it to be very useful for my future career.\
\
Our project revolved around the design of a comprehensive database tailored for a car rental company. This database encompasses crucial information related to the rented cars, insurance policies associated with these vehicles, rental data, customer details, and invoices. The primary objective of creating this database was to assist the car rental company in organizing and structuring their data efficiently. By leveraging the data, the company aims to enhance various aspects of their business operations, including the development of strategic marketing initiatives.\
\
The project involved the systematic process of designing the database, starting with the creation of an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD), followed by the implementation of the database using SQLite software. Key activities during the execution phase included:\
\
1. Identifying the attributes and entities to be incorporated into the database.\
2. Establishing primary and foreign keys to define relationships between entities.\
3. Creating individual tables for each entity, accompanied by their respective attributes.\
4. Defining rules for specific columns, incorporating calculations between other columns. For instance, the 'TOTAL_COST' is computed by summing 'RENTAL_COST,' 'INSURANCE_COST,' and 'TAX.'\
5. Implementing access restrictions to safeguard the integrity of the database, including the implementation of password protection.\
5. Conducting diverse analyses to extract valuable insights from the data.\
All these processes were meticulously executed through SQL queries, which are documented in the 'Script Project UAS_Kelompok 5.sql' file.\
