# Database-Sains-Data
My team's final project in the Database for Sains Data course\
\
Database Sains Data is one of the elective courses in the Statistics program at the University of Indonesia that I took in my fourth semester. This course is designed to enable students to retrieve, modify, and analyze data from a database using SQL with logical principles. The course was a great opportunity for me to learn how to work with databases and how to use SQL to extract valuable insights from data. I enjoyed the course and found it to be very useful for my future career.
